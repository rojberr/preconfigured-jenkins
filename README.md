# preconfigured-jenkins

This repository creates preconfigured Jenkins container to download Your repos and run their Jenkins.file.
An exemplary instance was deployed here :point_right: [http://165.22.66.191:8080/](http://165.22.66.191:8080/) :feelsgood:
I use it daily to build and check my own GitHub code.

## Usage

To use this CI/CD repo:

- clone it,
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rojberr/preconfigured-jenkins.git
```

- in `custom-jenkins-config` change the repositories URL to match your GitHub repository URLs,

- add `Jenkinsfile` to your GitHub repositories (make sure they are public) and define your pipeline steps there,

- define admin login and password:

```bash
export JENKINS_ADMIN_ID=...
export JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=...
```
- build and run container:

```bash
./gradlew build docker dockerRun
```

- log in as admin and enjoy your dockerized Jenkins for GitHub jobs ðŸ’•

To stop it use:
```bash
./gradlew dockerStop
```

## How it works?

The createJobs.groovy files will be used by Jenkins job DSL plugin to create build/test job.

This repository uses Infrastructure as a Code philosophy, setting everything up.
